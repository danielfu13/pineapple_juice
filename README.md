  ## Project Description

  This task for this project was to create an interactive MERN Stack Single-Page application. As a group, we have created a user-focused MERN app using a scalable MongoDB back end, a GraphQL API, and an Express.js and Node.js server with a React front end, implementing user authentication with JWT to build a user-focused platform. We have created a Exercise-Tracker App that helps users keep track of daily workouts. 
  
  ## User Story

  * As a user I want to be able to add my own set of exercises
